## Best Practices

1. **Keep it short** — 5-10 minutes max
2. **Mix question types** — Multiple choice, scales, and open-ended
3. **Avoid leading questions** — Don't assume they want the feature
4. **Include a "not interested" option** — Get honest feedback
5. **End with open-ended** — Capture insights you didn't think to ask about

## Question Types to Use

- **Likert scales** (1-5) for measuring intensity
- **Multiple choice** for categorical preferences
- **Ranking** for prioritization
- **Open text** for qualitative insights
- **Matrix questions** for comparing multiple items on same scale
